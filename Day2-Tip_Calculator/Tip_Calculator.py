# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# What was the total bill? $124.56
# How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
